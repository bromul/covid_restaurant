# covid_restaurant
Current side project. When it's finished, it will (hopefully!) take data from restaurant reviews and map them, showing where the commenter mentions the food had no taste, smell, etc., in order to estimate COVID hotspots

Also, this an attempt to practice my coding and learn some more skills that may be relevant for the project, such as Natural Language Processing.
